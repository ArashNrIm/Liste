## Introduction
Welcome to **Listé**, a simple and open-sourced to-do list app for everyone.

Whether you're a developer or user using the app, Listé was built for everyone in mind. I plan on open-sourcing most of the project's components; however, I'm only focusing on developing the app at this point in time. If you are a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

## Getting Started
Thanks for your interest in trying out this project. The explanation on how to get started is detailed and therefore fairly long, so it has been moved to [the wiki](https://github.com/arashnrim/Liste/wiki/Building-List%C3%A9). Visit the wiki to get started on cloning, running, and contributing to the project from your end.

### For designers
The user interface prototype can be found on Figma. [Check it out](https://www.figma.com/file/zTOJkVOZh2QUJb4FIlEdIu/List%C3%A9-%E2%80%94-UI-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1), make some changes if you'd like, and share your thoughts to improve the design of the app. It's preferable to open an issue in the Issue Tracker page of this repository to discuss user interface changes.

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, I recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), it is strongly advised against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Listé is an existing project, and subsequently a version 1.0 (latest 1.1.0) exists. While the App Store contains the app, the app is currently unusable at this point as I'm rewriting the code. Here's what I plan for the next few versions, starting from version 1.2.0:

**Listé 1.2.0**
- Encryption. Secure tasks and be assured of your privacy; all data stored is encrypted and non-readable without a set master password.

**Listé 2.0.0+**
- Collaborative Lists. A simple, innovative way to share a List with people.
- Local storage. Version 1.0 emphasises a mostly online structure, unnecessarily using data to sync with the online database (Firebase). In the new version, I'm only making Collaborative Lists (a new feature) to store data online; everything else uses UserDefaults or other forms of local storage.
- Dark mode. A nice-looking native dark theme for the app.

## Contributing
Please review the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed elaborations of the how and what to contribute.

This project is **accepting contributions**. If there's something broken or something you'd like to add, **fork the repository**, **create a branch** and **create a pull request** once you're done working.

## Acknowledgements
I'd want to thank everyone who spends their time and effort in contributing to this project. While it's a small app that probably doesn't have much of a user base, I hope that it's useful to you in some way — be it helping you learn to code, or helping you organise your tasks as a user.

This project was developed in the [Code with Friends: Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/) coding event. Thank you to everyone along the way who offered guidance and assistance during this event!
