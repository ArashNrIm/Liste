## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank everyone who spends their time and effort in contributing to this project. While Listé is a small app that probably does not have much of a user base, I hope that it is useful to some people in some way — be it helping to learn code, or helping to organise tasks as a user.

This project would not have been created if not for the [Swift Accelerator Programme](https://swiftinsg.org). Thank you to everyone who has helped us — from start to finish — for the initial version of the app!

This project was developed in the [Code with Friends: Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/) coding event. Thank you to everyone along the way who offered guidance and assistance during this event!
